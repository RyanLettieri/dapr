# Dapr 1.9.1

### Fixes cosmosDB etag crash on transaction request

#### Problem

When setting any etag in a transaction request inside CosmosDB, dapr exits due to a nil pointer dereference.

### Impact

This issue impacts all users of CosmosDB state store.

#### Root cause

When setting an eTag on a transaction request in cosmosDB state store, a nil pointer was being dereferenced. 

#### Solution

We have changed the cosmosDB statestore code to correctly use the address rather than the pointer of the eTag
