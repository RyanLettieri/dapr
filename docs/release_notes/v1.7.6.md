# Dapr 1.7.6

- Fixes nil dereference crash in placement membership heartbeat loop in sidecar

## Fixes panic in actor placement membership in Dapr sidecar

### Problem

When recovering from a failure in the connection to the Dapr placement service, the Dapr sidecar could have encountered a panic in some cases.

### Impact

The issue can impact all Dapr users on Dapr 1.7.0-1.9.4 using actors.

### Root cause

We identified a race condition in the actor placement service client that could have caused the Dapr to panic after recovering from a failure.

### Solution

We updated actor placement service to address the race condition and remove the cause for the panic.
